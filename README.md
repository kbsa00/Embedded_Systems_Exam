# HomeWatcher - Embedded project


#### HomeWatcher
Using a Particle Photon I have created my own Alarm System for my studentdoorm. The HomeWatcher *as I call it* will 
notify you through push messages whenever someone walks past it. 
****
#### Components: 
* DHT11
* Particle Photon
* Buzzer
* Buttons
* Led Light
* Ultra Sonic Sensor

****
#### Features
The HomeWatcher will notify you through slack whenever someone walks past it and when this occured. 
You have also the opertunity of turning of the alarm system through your phone or physically pushing the buttons on it. 
It also has a LED light that indicates if the system is on or not. I have also created a feature where you pause the system for
30 seconds. After these 30 seconds the alarm will then turn it self on again. 

Using the DHT11-sensor (Tempratur and humidity) I have also programmed the HomeWatcher to send you status on the tempratur and humidity 
for your studentdorm room
